# Color C Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** April 29, 2025

# 1. Information We Collect

Color C **does not collect or store any personal data** from users.

The app requests access to the **camera** solely so users can take a picture and identify colors. The image remains on the device and is not sent to any servers.

When the user selects a point on the image for analysis, the **hexadecimal color value** extracted (e.g., `#A1B2C3`) is sent to an external API to retrieve the color name and related suggestions (such as complementary colors).

# 2. Use of Information

The only information shared externally is the hexadecimal color value selected by the user. This information **is not associated with any personal identity** and is used exclusively for visual features within the app (e.g., displaying the color name and suggestions).

# 3. Information Sharing

Color C **does not share any personal information** with third parties. The color value sent to the external API **cannot be used to identify the user**.

# 4. Permissions Requested

- **Camera**: To take photos and identify colors.
- **Internet**: To fetch color data from the color naming API.

# 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Notifications about significant changes will be displayed in the app or through our official channels.

# 6. Contact
